### **What to Work on First?**  
Since this is a **peer-to-peer CLI-based file-sharing app**, the best approach is to build it in layers. Here's the recommended order:

---

## **1️⃣ Set Up the CLI (Basic Commands)**
🔹 **Why?** This provides an interface for users to interact with the app.  
🔹 **How?** Use `Cobra` to define commands like `share`, `list`, and `download`.  

✅ **Steps:**  
1. Create the project structure (`p2p-file-sharing/`).  
2. Initialize a Go module (`go mod init github.com/yourusername/p2p-file-sharing`).  
3. Install Cobra: `go get -u github.com/spf13/cobra`  
4. Create a CLI skeleton (`cmd/root.go`).  

---

## **2️⃣ Implement Peer Discovery**  
🔹 **Why?** The app needs to find other peers before transferring files.  
🔹 **How?** Use `libp2p` or a simple TCP-based discovery method.  

✅ **Steps:**  
1. Create `internal/discovery/peer.go`.  
2. Implement a **bootstrap node** or **DHT** to track peers.  
3. Make peers exchange their IPs & IDs.  

---

## **3️⃣ Build the Networking Layer**  
🔹 **Why?** The app needs a way to send and receive data between peers.  
🔹 **How?** Use **TCP or UDP sockets** for direct connections.  

✅ **Steps:**  
1. Create `internal/network/server.go` (listens for connections).  
2. Create `internal/network/client.go` (connects to other peers).  
3. Implement **message exchange** between peers.  

---

## **4️⃣ Implement File Transfer**  
🔹 **Why?** This is the core feature—actually sharing the files.  
🔹 **How?** Split files into chunks and send them over the network.  

✅ **Steps:**  
1. Create `internal/file/transfer.go`.  
2. Implement **chunked file transfer** (use `io.Copy()` or send in pieces).  
3. Add a checksum mechanism to verify file integrity.  

---

## **5️⃣ Add a File Indexing System**  
🔹 **Why?** So peers can request a file by name or ID.  
🔹 **How?** Store file metadata in a simple database (SQLite, JSON, or BoltDB).  

✅ **Steps:**  
1. Store shared file metadata (name, size, hash, peer ID).  
2. Implement the `list` command to query available files.  

---

## **6️⃣ Optimize & Secure the App**
🔹 **Why?** Prevent malicious users from exploiting the system.  
🔹 **How?** Use **encryption** and **rate limiting**.  

✅ **Steps:**  
1. Add **end-to-end encryption** for file transfers.  
2. Implement **rate limiting** to prevent spam.
